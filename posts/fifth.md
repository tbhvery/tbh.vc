hello internet! i am tired and sore from golfing 18 holes (i tuckered myself on the driving range in the first hour) so this blog entry will be shorter. also thank goodness it's not daylight savings!

i'm currently listening to [c418](https://c418.bandcamp.com) - it's good nostalgic music. helps me focus when i'm reading or if i'm working on things like this website.

[i read a little bit more](/posts/fourth) of *think faster talk smarter* and some of the points it brings up were new to me surprisingly (although, i'm not the best at communicating in the first place). i liked the bit about heuristics and how to avoid them. otherwise, the book is pretty standard for a self-help book.
