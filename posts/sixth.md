hello internet; welcome to another awesome blog post

i may or may not have time to work on this website this weekend. i've done a lot of nothing these past two days, but i did get myself a new phone, a used iphone 15 pro, and i've been setting it up all day. i previously had a pixel 8 pro and have had to use android pretty much my entire life. nothing wrong with android, but the reason i went apple was because my family mostly uses it (and i like using my m1 macbook pro).

i am hoping to keep it minimalistic and relegate its use to only text/phone calls, photos, and music (i use youtube music since i pay for a youtube premium family plan). i also have obsidian and track my health using withings. if i install any other applications, i will keep this blog informed. the idea is to, again, keep everything minimalistic, and anything else can be done on my web browser ([i use vivaldi btw](https://vivaldi.com)). i think paying for my own phone plan and starting with a fresh new environment (i already used iphones at work so ios not foreign to me) will help me at least in the short term... i'll need to be disciplined and intentional now if i want to keep it as clean as it is now further down the line. i really need to read *discipline is destiny* by ryan holiday. if you haven't noticed i like to read self-help books...

anyways i'm breaking bed- baking bread right now so i'm kind of multitasking right now. i'm hoping this shokupan comes out good, because the dough seemed a little too dry in my opinion. we'll see how it comes out.

i just checked on it, it's looking pretty good! anyway, see ya.
