hello internet welcome to another blog post!

i need to learn to speak my mind more often. i've updated the front page to show my current status on [status.cafe](https://status.cafe); it'll give you guys a fun way to see what i'm currently thinking. this is in addition to writing more blog posts. i don't plan on having a set schedule, but i would like it to be a regular habit.

instead of reading *digital minimalism* like i said i would in my [last post](/third) (i've read a little and will give my thoughts in another post), i've been reading *think faster talk smarter* by matt abrahams. i've always struggled with expressing my thoughts and opinions, so i thought it would be a good book to pick up. so far (i just got done with the first first part so i'm not that far) it offers pretty generic self-help advice but with its own spin. so basically every self-help book. one point that stuck out to me in the book was to catch whenever you say filler phrases like "um" or "like" and instead inhale to add some sort of pause. i'll also need to learn to slow my body language, this apparently will help with my anxiety when speaking.

by the way, don't buy your books unless if you really like the book and plan on reading it multiple times. get a library card and get your ebooks/audiobooks from [libby](https://libbyapp.com/) (not sponsored) if your library supports it. i just highly recommend the service because it's basically free ebooks and i can send books directly to my kindle.

speaking of kindle, is it worth jailbreaking my kindle paperwhite if i only use it for reading books on libby? i don't really see a need, but i've been [recommended videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ZliC82RtA) on youtube about it. i guess a customized reading client would be cool. i'll think about it and report back if i do.

anyway, i'm playing some golf tomorrow with some work buddies so that'll be fun. i suck at golf. :P
