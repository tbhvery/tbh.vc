hip hip hurray! the blog is now a separate page and not shoved in the home page.

that should reduce the visual clutter on the home page, but i will need to add something to prevent the home page from looking too plain; we'll need to reference back to [the future of tbh.vc](/posts/first).

i still don't have a solid grasp of what this website should encompass - a purpose for the website basically. yeah, it's a quirky little site, but it's a bit directionless. right now it's basically an excuse to work on my own thing and to keep away from social media platforms. youtube's a hard one to quit, though. ;-;

currently, i have *digital minimalism* by cal newport on my desk. i would like to start reading it by next weekend. i'll probably give my thoughts on the book throughout.
