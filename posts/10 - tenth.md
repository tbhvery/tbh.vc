hello internet! time to get somewhat personal.

i probably have adhd - never was diagnosed with it, but i wouldn't be surprised if i was. the main problem i have with it is my executive dysfunction. i have issues sticking with things - let alone initiating them in the first place.

due to a combination of reasons, including my perceived adhd, i never felt i was at my full potential when it came to software development. the rise of llms and other ai tools have not helped with this at all either.

i feel like my software development skills are undermined due to how good llm's have gotten at writing code. why would i copy and paste some boilerplate code from stackoverflow when i could get a custom solution using chatgpt? i'll still have to comb through the code and then fix any issues i find from either solution. the moral and environmental implications are there, but they are not enough for me to not justify using these tools.

anyways, i went for a 3am run since i couldn't sleep last night, my first workout for the year i suppose. i would like to find a daily schedule that works for me. i like waking up during ungodly hours (3-4am), but that would require me to sacrifice my evening time.

i spend way too much time on youtube. ;-;
