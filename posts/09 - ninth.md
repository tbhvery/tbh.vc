hello interwebz,

the goal for this blog is to reach 100 posts.

100 posts containing my unfiltered random thoughts - ok they're a little filtered... but as unfiltered as i can get them. my new years resolution was to be more open to people this year. it's very difficult for me to open up. ;-;

this website and blog i suppose will support me with this endeavor since i can't really tell if people are reading these. if it's out there then what do i have to hide - am i right?

i'll continue working on this site to make it more "aesthetic". as described in the [previous post](https://tbh.vc/posts/eighth/), i'm not satisfied with the current state of the website (nor was i ever). that may be the perfectionist in me, but i could definitely do better to spruce up the place.

what is this website to me? that's what i'm still trying to figure out. i don't want to park on this domain just for the sake of the name... i want it to actually serve some sort of purpose. i like the tbh creature, but to be honest (aha!), there's so much you can do with the little guy.

again, as described in the [previous post](https://tbh.vc/posts/eighth/), i mentioned i am getting into game development. i'd hate to think of it as a sort of potential side hustle, but it's kind of the reality. i've always wanted to make games, but i've never had the attention span to actually finish a fully fledged game. only [little tid bits](https://tbhvery.github.io/pong/). maybe i should publish that pong game on here...

speaking of "potential side hustles", i want tbhvc to be a video games studio, but i think that's just too ambitious. i just want to be an indie game developer. it would be pretty neat. i think i have some good ideas, but isn't that true for every aspiring game developer? i've got decent enough programming experience and i have an eye for art/music...
