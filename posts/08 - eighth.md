hello internet! it's been a while. happy new year!!!

i want to redesign this website. i'll explain down below in more detail, but 

i want it to be easier for me to post stuff on here. i guess i'm using obsidian to edit these blog posts now (i was previously just writing them in vscode). i already use obsidian as my primary note taking app, so i'm pretty used to it.

i wanna make video games... i bought a book and i am starting to make games in godot. my executive dysfunction kind of hinders me though so it's been tough.
