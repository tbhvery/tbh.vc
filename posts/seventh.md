hello internet! i've added a [musics page](/music) and added my first album, [*tbh rpg adventures*](/music)!! well, the term album is *generous*. it's a collection of small songs that kind of convey an idea rather than actual music. i've been making little songs like this for the past 5 years in FL Studio primarily using [miniBit](https://www.audiothing.net/instruments/minibit/) (i got from humble bundle :P). 

update on my phone, i had to install some more apps. first of all, i installed my grocery store's app for scanning items and adding coupons. i shop at smith's since that's the closest grocery store to me.

hey i'm also customizing my steam deck finally using [decky loader](https://decky.xyz). maybe i'll start using it more. i do need to clear [my backlog...](https://steamcommunity.com/id/tbhvery/)
